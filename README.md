## What I Learned / Gained Experience With

- MERN Stack
- Redux Toolkit
- styled-components
- Stripe
- localStorage
- React Router
- axios
- jsonwebtoken

## App Features

- automatic image slider with manual controls
- search bar with autocomplete
- guest cart that also gets saved upon registration
- login/register
- product filters and sorts
- color and size options for product
- auto logout when jwt expires
- mobile-responsive

## Future Improvements

- change color and size properties in product schema to be strings, give different product id for each color and size, and then do product lookups by title instead of id
- remove duplicates from search results (because using same image and title for different sizes)
- remove items from cart if they have been deleted from database
- add number in stock property to products schema to limit number of items customer can buy
- add admin dashboard to easily add, remove, or update products
